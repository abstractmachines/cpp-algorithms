# C++11

We will be using C++11 and the C++ Standard Library for our algorithms.

This section includes information on how to use modern C++ for algorithm
problem solving.

## Assertions versus Exceptions and error handling : When to use

**Exceptions and error handling are for situations in which control flow

as possible. Recovery - or reporting errors nicely to user - is the goal.**

**Assertions crash your program.**

Assertions are used to check that a program or API is operating properly.
