High Level Algorithm:
Do a counting sort:
Create a second array that's max = max data size
sort all elements by frequency with one pass

1. Counting sort: need to know the max data element and definition of set data
This data set's range is ASCII. Generally the ASCII chart is a 0-127 range,
for 128 values. That would mean that we can represent these values with

#define RANGE 127
